# Word association graph
------------------------

This graph contains the links of a word association graph obtained from the South Florida Free Association norms list available at http://www.usf.edu/FreeAssociation/

In this graph, each word is represented by a node and cooccurence between two arbitrary words reprensents by an edges between associated nodes.

The node size illustrates the word ranking base on PageRank algorithm.
The node color identifies words into a group of their neighbours base on their cooccurrences using Louvain algorithm.
